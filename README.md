## Tools and Technologies ⚙️💻

### 1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)
AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with AWS services directly from the terminal. It simplifies managing cloud resources by providing commands for a wide range of AWS services, enabling tasks such as provisioning, managing, and automating workflows with ease.

### 2. [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/)
LocalStack is a fully functional, local testing environment for AWS services. It enables developers to simulate AWS services on their local machines, facilitating the development and testing of cloud-based applications without needing access to an actual AWS account.

### 3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to build, share, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production by packaging the application and its dependencies together.

### 4. [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)  
Boto3 is the official AWS SDK for Python, enabling developers to interact with AWS services programmatically. It provides a high-level, easy-to-use interface for managing AWS resources like S3, EC2, DynamoDB, and more.  

### 5. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)  
Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework designed for building web applications and APIs. It follows a minimalistic approach, providing essential tools while allowing developers to add extensions as needed.

## Directory Structure 📂

- **Codes** 💻 (If applicable)  
  Contains code files used for the data processing and analysis in each experiment. These files are critical for performing the tasks required in the experiment.
  - e.g., `main.py`, `process_data.py`

- **Documentation** 📝  
  This folder contains detailed documentation for each experiment, including methodology, analysis, and insights. Documentation is provided in both Markdown (`.md`) and PDF formats for easy reference.
  - `documentation.md` (Markdown version of the documentation)
  - `documentation.pdf` (PDF version of the documentation)

- **Dataset** 📁 (If applicable)  
  Contains the datasets used for analysis in each experiment. Datasets are placed here to ensure easy access and organization.
  - e.g., `data.csv`, `stream_data.json`

- **Output** 📊  
  Stores the output generated from each experiment, including visualizations, data analysis results, and any other relevant outputs.
  - `Experiment X Output` (where "X" refers to the relevant experiment number)

### Explanation of Folders:

- **Codes Folder (💻):**  
  Contains the source code used for the experiment. If the experiment involves running scripts or programs, the corresponding code files go here.

- **Dataset Folder (📁):**  
  This folder stores the dataset used in an experiment. If a dataset is involved (like a `.csv`, `.json`, or any data file), it will be placed here.

- **Output Folder (📊):**  
  Stores the outputs/results generated by the experiments. This might include processed data, logs, or result files. Each experiment’s output is stored separately with a relevant name.

- **Documentation Folder (📝):**  
  Contains the documentation of each experiment, provided in both `.md` and `.pdf` formats. The Markdown file is converted to PDF using the provided link for Markdown to PDF conversion.

- **Commands File (📋):**  
  A text file documenting the specific commands or steps used in the experiment, especially useful for command-line operations.
