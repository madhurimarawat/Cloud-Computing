## Virtual Machine

A **virtual machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine. It operates in an isolated environment, using allocated resources such as CPU, memory, and storage from the host system. VMs are widely used in cloud computing to create scalable, on-demand instances, allowing users to deploy and manage applications without needing dedicated hardware. They provide flexibility, cost efficiency, and security by enabling multiple VMs to run on a single physical server, each operating independently with its own configurations and software stack.

### **Prerequisites**

### **Docker Setup**

Since LocalStack uses Docker to simulate AWS services locally, follow these steps to install it:

### 1. **Install Docker on the System**

- Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- During installation, ensure the following options are selected:
  - "Install required Windows components for WSL 2" (if using WSL 2).
  - Restart the machine if prompted to complete the installation.

---

### 2. **Verify Docker Installation**

- Open a command prompt or PowerShell and run the following command to check if Docker is installed:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```
- If Docker is successfully installed, a version number will appear, for example: `Docker version 24.0.2, build abcdef`.

---

### 3. **Start Docker Desktop**

- Launch Docker Desktop and wait until it indicates that "Docker is running."

---

### 4. **Enable WSL 2 Integration (If Required)**

- If Docker is not running on Windows, enable WSL 2 by following these steps:
  1. Open **Docker Desktop** settings.
  2. Go to **General** and check the option **"Use the WSL 2-based engine."**
  3. Apply the changes and restart **Docker Desktop**.

---

### LocalStack Installation

1. **Install LocalStack**:

   - LocalStack can be installed via pip:
     ```bash
     pip install localstack
     ```
   - Alternatively, it can be pulled from Docker:
     ```bash
     docker pull localstack/localstack
     ```

2. **Start LocalStack**:

   - For running LocalStack with Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 localstack/localstack
     ```
   - If LocalStack is installed locally:
     ```bash
     localstack start
     ```

3. **Install AWS CLI**:

   - If the AWS CLI is not already installed:
     ```bash
     pip install awscli
     ```

4. **Configure AWS CLI for LocalStack**:

   - The AWS CLI can be configured using default credentials, as LocalStack does not require actual AWS credentials:

     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

     - Access Key ID: `test`
     - Secret Access Key: `test`
     - Region: `us-east-1`

   - To configure the AWS CLI to connect to LocalStack:
     ```bash
     export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
     ```

   During the `aws configure` setup, the AWS CLI will prompt for configuration details, including the **output format**, which controls the display style of results from AWS CLI commands.

### Common Output Formats:

1. **JSON** (default): A structured data format, ideal for automation and scripting.

   Example:

   ```json
   {
     "Key": "Value",
     "AnotherKey": "AnotherValue"
   }
   ```

2. **Table**: A human-readable table format, ideal for quick reviews.

   Example:

   ```
   +------------+----------------+
   |   Key      |    Value       |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Key1       | Value1         |
   | Key2       | Value2         |
   +------------+----------------+
   ```

3. **Text**: A simple plain-text format, suitable for scripts or command-line parsing.

   Example:

   ```
   Key1 Value1
   Key2 Value2
   ```

---

### Choosing the Output Format

During the `aws configure` setup, users can:

- Accept the **default** format by pressing **Enter** to select `json`.
- Alternatively, specify a different format by typing one of the following:
  - `json`
  - `table`
  - `text`

Example:

```
Default output format [json]: table
```

---

### How to Change the Output Format Later

If a user wishes to change the output format after the initial configuration, they can:

1. Manually edit the AWS CLI configuration file:

   - Open `~/.aws/config` (on Linux/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config` (on Windows).
   - Modify the `output` setting:
     ```
     [default]
     output = text
     ```

2. Use the `--output` flag when running commands:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls --output table
   ```

---

### Resolving the `Failed to connect to localhost port 4566` Error

When encountering the error `Failed to connect to localhost port 4566`, it typically indicates that no service is running on that port. To resolve this issue:

1. **Check if LocalStack is Running:**

   - To verify if LocalStack is running, users can check the container or process status by executing the following command:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

2. **Verify Port Mapping and LocalStack Startup:**

   - If using Docker, ensure the correct ports are mapped. If running LocalStack locally, users should confirm its successful startup by checking the logs or re-running the following command:
     ```bash
     localstack start
     ```

---

### **Limitations in LocalStack**

- LocalStack provides a basic simulation of AWS EC2 but does not support actual VM provisioning.
- For working with real VMs locally, users should consider using hypervisors such as **VirtualBox**, **VMware**, or combining LocalStack with these tools for a hybrid setup.

This setup is ideal for students looking to interact with a simulated cloud environment, allowing them to practice API calls and configurations without incurring any cloud service costs.

HINT: This error might have occurred since this system does not have Windows Long Path support enabled.
You can find information on how to enable this at https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/enable-long-paths
```

The error indicates that **Windows Long Path Support** is not enabled, which is necessary because some files in the `localstack` installation exceed the default path length limit of 260 characters on Windows.

Here are the steps to resolve this:

---

### **Steps to Enable Windows Long Path Support**

1. **Enable Long Paths in the Windows Registry:**

   - Open the **Run dialog** (`Win + R`), type `regedit`, and press Enter.
   - Navigate to the following key:
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem
     ```
   - Look for the `LongPathsEnabled` entry. If it does not exist, create a new `DWORD` (32-bit) value named `LongPathsEnabled`.
   - Set its value to `1`.

2. **Enable Long Paths Using Group Policy (for Pro, Education, or Enterprise Editions):**

   - Open the **Run dialog** (`Win + R`), type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter.
   - Navigate to:
     ```
     Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Filesystem
     ```
   - Double-click on **Enable Win32 long paths**.
   - Set it to **Enabled**, then click **OK**.

3. **Restart the System:**

   - After making the necessary changes, users should restart their computer to apply them.

---

### **Retry Installing `localstack`**

Once Long Path Support is enabled, users can retry the installation with the following command:

```bash
pip install localstack
```

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Upgrade Pip**: It’s recommended to ensure that the latest version of pip is being used:

  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

- **Use a Virtual Environment**: To avoid making system-wide changes, users can create a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install localstack
  ```

- **Check Python Compatibility**: Ensure that the Python version is compatible with the `localstack` version being installed.

### Issue with the `export` Command on Windows

The `export` command is used in Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS to set environment variables. However, it is not recognized in Windows Command Prompt (CMD). In CMD, the `set` command should be used instead to set environment variables.

To resolve the issue, replace the `export` command with the `set` command in CMD:

```cmd
set AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
```

### Notes:

1. If using PowerShell, the environment variable can be set with the following command:

   ```powershell
   $env:AWS_ENDPOINT_URL = "http://localhost:4566"
   ```

2. For a persistent environment variable across sessions, use the `setx` command to set it permanently:
   ```cmd
   setx AWS_ENDPOINT_URL "http://localhost:4566"
   ```
   **Caution:** The variable set with `setx` will only be available in new CMD or PowerShell sessions.

To verify the environment variable is set correctly, run the following:

```cmd
echo %AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%
```

This should display:

```
http://localhost:4566
```

---

## Starting Services

### 1. **Ensure the Service is Running**

- If LocalStack or another AWS emulator is being used, it's essential to confirm that it has started successfully.

  - For **LocalStack**:
    ```cmd
    localstack start
    ```
  - For **Docker** (if LocalStack is running via Docker):
    ```cmd
    docker run -p 4566:4566 -d localstack/localstack
    ```
    After executing this, the following command can be used to confirm the container is running:
    ```cmd
    docker ps
    ```

---

### 2. **Verify Port Availability**

- To check if another service is using port `4566`, the following command should be run:
  ```cmd
  netstat -ano | find "4566"
  ```
  - If no output is returned, it indicates the port is free.
  - If output is returned, it's necessary to identify which process is using the port by executing:
    ```cmd
    tasklist /FI "PID eq <PID>"
    ```
    Replace `<PID>` with the process ID found from the `netstat` output.

---

### 3. **Check Firewall or Antivirus Settings**

- It should be ensured that no firewall or antivirus software is blocking connections to port `4566`.
- Temporarily disabling the firewall or antivirus can help in testing.

---

### 4. **Confirm localhost Works**

- To check if `localhost` is working correctly on the system, the following command can be used:
  ```cmd
  ping localhost
  ```
- If there is no response, replacing `localhost` with `127.0.0.1` is recommended:
  ```cmd
  set AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4566
  ```

---

### 5. **Validate `curl` Setup**

- It is crucial to confirm that `curl` is installed and functioning correctly by running:
  ```cmd
  curl --version
  ```
- If `curl` is not found, it can be downloaded from [curl's official website](https://curl.se/download.html) or enabled through Windows Features.

---

### 6. **Restart System or Docker**

- A system restart and/or restarting Docker could help resolve any lingering issues.
- After restarting, the desired service (e.g., LocalStack) should be started again.

---

### 7. **Manually Test Another Port**

- To manually test connectivity to `localhost`, a simple web server can be run using the following command:
  ```cmd
  python -m http.server 4566
  ```
  Then, the server can be accessed with:
  ```cmd
  curl http://localhost:4566
  ```
  - If this works, it suggests the issue lies with the service running on port `4566`.
  - If it doesn’t work, there may be a network configuration issue.

---

### **Troubleshooting Docker Desktop Sign-Out Issues**

If Docker Desktop keeps signing out automatically, several common causes and fixes should be considered:

---

### **1. Enable Trusted Root Certificates**

- Docker Desktop may fail to authenticate if the required root certificates are missing or untrusted.
- **Solution**:
  1. The system’s date and time should be confirmed to be correct.
  2. The certificates can be updated by running the following command:
     ```cmd
     certutil -generateSSTFromWU roots.sst
     ```
  3. The `roots.sst` file can then be double-clicked to install the certificates.

---

### **2. Clear Docker Credentials**

- Cached credentials might be causing the sign-out issues.
- **Solution**:
  1. Navigate to the Docker configuration folder:
     ```
     C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.docker
     ```
  2. The `config.json` file should be deleted.
  3. Docker Desktop should be restarted, and the user should sign in again.

If Docker is not running, it should automatically troubleshoot and restart itself.

---

### **LocalStack Container Image Download Process**

The following output indicates that **LocalStack is attempting to pull the container image `localstack/localstack`** to run in Docker mode, which suggests that the setup is working up to this point. Here's what's happening:

```bash
C:\Users\rawat>docker images
REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
Pulling container image localstack/localstack
```

---

### **What’s Happening?**

1. **LocalStack CLI Detected Docker Mode**:

   - `[11:20:31] starting LocalStack in Docker mode` confirms that LocalStack is trying to run using Docker.

2. **Container Image Not Found Locally**:

   - `[11:25:13] container image not found on host` indicates that Docker is downloading the `localstack/localstack` image from Docker Hub since it’s not found locally.

3. **Pulling the Container Image**:
   - `⠧ Pulling container image localstack/localstack` confirms that the image download process is ongoing.

---

### **What to Expect Next**

- If the internet connection is stable, Docker should complete the download in a few minutes.
- After the image is downloaded, LocalStack will initialize, and the services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) will start. This will be confirmed by further logs.

---

### **How to Verify It’s Working**

1. After the image download is complete, the user can check if the container is running with the following command:

   ```cmd
   docker ps
   ```

   The container should be listed with the name `localstack`.

2. To verify that LocalStack is running, the endpoint should be accessed:
   ```cmd
   curl http://localhost:4566
   ```
   A response should be returned, confirming that LocalStack is active.

---

### **If Pulling Takes Too Long**

- Check the **internet speed** and Docker's ability to pull images:
  ```cmd
  docker pull localstack/localstack
  ```
- If the pull succeeds, proceed to rerun the LocalStack command:
  ```cmd
  python "C:\Users\rawat\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts\\localstack" start
  ```

After successfully pulling the image, run the following to verify:

```bash
C:\Users\rawat>docker images
REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
localstack/localstack latest b686f3948f42 4 hours ago 1.18GB
hello-world latest 74cc54e27dc4 31 hours ago 10.1kB
```

If issues persist after pulling `hello-world`, follow these steps:

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. Then, execute:
   ```bash
   localstack start
   ```

### **Steps to Set Up a Virtual Machine in LocalStack**

1. **Simulate EC2 Service**:

   LocalStack emulates a limited set of EC2 functionalities. The goal is to create mock resources like key pairs, security groups, and instances.

2. **Create a Key Pair**:

   Use the AWS CLI to generate a key pair:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name local-key --endpoint-url=%AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%
   ```

   The output will include the generated public/private key pair.

3. **Create a Security Group**:

   Create a security group to define network rules:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name local-sg --description "Local Security Group" --endpoint-url=%AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%
   ```

4. **Run an Instance**:

   Launch a mock EC2 instance using:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 run-instances
     --image-id ami-12345678
     --count 1
     --instance-type t2.micro
     --key-name local-key
     --security-group-ids sg-12345678
     --endpoint-url=%AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%
   ```

   Replace `ami-12345678` with an example AMI ID that is recognized by LocalStack.

   Example output:

   - Security Group ID: sg-2cd410ccd533c7f8b
   - Image ID: ami-a2678d778fc6

### Command:

```cmd
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-a2678d778fc6 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name local-key --security-group-ids sg-2cd410ccd533c7f8b --endpoint-url=%AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%
```

---

### **Explanation of Parameters**

1. **`aws ec2 run-instances`**

   - This is the AWS CLI command to launch one or more Amazon EC2 instances.

2. **`--image-id ami-a2678d778fc6`**

   - **What it is:** The unique ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you want to use.
   - **Why it matters:** An AMI is like a template that defines what the instance will look like, including its operating system, software, and configuration.
   - **Example:** If you want to run an Ubuntu server, you select an AMI ID for an Ubuntu image.

3. **`--count 1`**

   - **What it is:** The number of EC2 instances to create.
   - **Why it matters:** You can launch multiple instances at once. In this case, `1` means you're creating a single instance.

4. **`--instance-type t2.micro`**

   - **What it is:** The type of EC2 instance to launch.
   - **Why it matters:** Instance types determine the amount of CPU, memory, and networking performance available.
   - **Example:** `t2.micro` is a small, low-cost instance type suitable for lightweight tasks or free-tier usage.

5. **`--key-name local-key`**

   - **What it is:** The name of the key pair to use for SSH access to your instance.
   - **Why it matters:** A key pair ensures secure access to the instance. You’ll need the private key file associated with this name to log in.

6. **`--security-group-ids sg-2cd410ccd533c7f8b`**

   - **What it is:** The ID of the security group to associate with the instance.
   - **Why it matters:** Security groups act as firewalls for your instance, controlling which traffic is allowed to enter or leave.
   - **Example:** You might configure it to allow SSH (port 22) or HTTP (port 80) traffic.

7. **`--endpoint-url=%AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%`**
   - **What it is:** Specifies a custom endpoint URL for your AWS service.
   - **Why it matters:** This is useful when working with a local AWS emulator (e.g., LocalStack) or custom AWS environments.
   - **Example:** `%AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%` expands to the URL you set earlier, such as `http://localhost:4566`.

---

### **What Happens When You Run This Command?**

- The AWS CLI will create a single EC2 instance based on the AMI (`ami-a2678d778fc6`).
- The instance will be of type `t2.micro`, suitable for low-resource tasks.
- The instance will use the `local-key` key pair for SSH access.
- The security group (`sg-2cd410ccd533c7f8b`) will control the traffic to and from the instance.
- The endpoint URL will be used to connect to the specified AWS service.

---

### Example Use Case

- We want to set up a small server (like an Ubuntu instance) locally for testing, using our custom AWS endpoint URL (`http://localhost:4566`) with specific security and access configurations.

5. **List Instances**:

   - Verify the instance creation:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-instances --endpoint-url=%AWS_ENDPOINT_URL%
     ```

---

### Creating an S3 Bucket in LocalStack

#### Commands Breakdown:

1. **List Existing Buckets:**

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 --region us-east-1 s3 ls
   ```

   - **Purpose:** This command is used to list the existing S3 buckets in your LocalStack environment, running at `localhost:4566`.
   - **Output:** No output is shown initially, meaning there are no buckets created at that point.

2. **Create a New S3 Bucket:**

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 --region
   us-east-1 s3 mb s3://my-test-bucket
   ```

   - **Purpose:** This command creates a new S3 bucket named `my-test-bucket` in the LocalStack environment.
   - **Output:** `make_bucket: my-test-bucket` — This confirms the successful creation of the `my-test-bucket`.

3. **List Buckets Again:**
   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 --region us-east-1 s3 ls
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This command lists the existing S3 buckets again, this time after creating the new bucket.
   - **Output:**
     ```
     2025-01-23 13:09:41 my-test-bucket
     ```
     — This confirms that the `my-test-bucket` is now listed and was successfully created.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **LocalStack’s Purpose:**

   - LocalStack emulates AWS services locally, providing an environment for developers to simulate AWS without needing an actual AWS account or incurring costs. It mimics APIs for various services such as S3, EC2, Lambda, etc., making it a useful tool for development and testing.

2. **CLI Commands and Output:**

   - The AWS CLI interacts directly with LocalStack through the endpoint `localhost:4566`, which is where the LocalStack service is running. Every time you run commands like `aws s3 mb` or `aws s3 ls`, LocalStack processes these commands as if they were sent to the actual AWS cloud.
   - After running the `aws s3 mb` command, LocalStack creates the `my-test-bucket` bucket in its emulated environment. The successful creation is confirmed by the output: `make_bucket: my-test-bucket`.
   - When you list the buckets with `aws s3 ls`, it shows the newly created bucket as `my-test-bucket`, confirming the operation was successful.

3. **Why the `localhost:4566` Page Remains Empty:**

   - `localhost:4566` is not intended to serve a graphical user interface (GUI) like the AWS Management Console. Instead, it acts as an endpoint for API requests from tools like the AWS CLI or SDKs.
   - LocalStack emulates AWS services by providing HTTP-based API endpoints. These APIs handle requests and respond accordingly, but LocalStack does not serve a web-based dashboard. Therefore, accessing `localhost:4566` via a browser will result in a blank or empty page, which is completely normal.
   - To interact with LocalStack, users should rely on the AWS CLI, SDKs, or other infrastructure management tools (like Terraform). These tools send API calls to LocalStack, which then processes and responds with the requested information or performs actions such as creating S3 buckets.

4. **Why the S3 Bucket Is Created:**

   - The `aws s3 mb` command in LocalStack simulates the creation of an S3 bucket, just as it would in AWS. In your case, the bucket `my-test-bucket` was created locally within LocalStack.
   - Even though LocalStack is emulating AWS S3 locally, the functionality is designed to be very similar to the actual AWS S3 service. Therefore, the `aws s3 ls` command shows the bucket because LocalStack has processed the request successfully and maintains an internal record of the bucket.

5. **Key Takeaways:**
   - **LocalStack is functional:** The successful creation and listing of the `my-test-bucket` confirm that LocalStack is operating correctly and the AWS CLI is interacting with it as expected.
   - **No graphical interface is provided at `localhost:4566`:** LocalStack is designed to work through API calls, not through a web dashboard.
   - **Use CLI for interaction:** For operations like creating buckets, listing them, or interacting with other AWS services, the AWS CLI or other tools should be used to send requests to LocalStack's API endpoints.

### Additional Information:

- **LocalStack's API works correctly:** The creation and listing of the S3 bucket (`my-test-bucket`) show that LocalStack's simulation of AWS services is functioning as expected.
- **No GUI at `localhost:4566`:** It's important to understand that LocalStack is API-driven, so there is no web interface at `localhost:4566`. Users should interact with LocalStack via command-line tools or SDKs to simulate AWS service operations locally.
